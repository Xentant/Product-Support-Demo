# Support Intelligence Loop

**Resolve what should be support. Eliminate what should not be support. Measure the difference.**

A working product prototype of a closed-loop system. It safely resolves today's support cases and identifies and validates the product changes that prevent tomorrow's.

> **Synthetic demonstration data.** "Lattice API Platform" is fictional. No real company, customer or product is represented. AI outputs in the app are pre-authored and deterministic. No live model or external service is called.

## The argument

High-volume support should not be managed only as a cost center. Support interactions are evidence about product quality.

The demo is built around one contradiction:

> The AI agent verifies resolution for **81%** of API-key-management contacts, yet the normalized contact rate rose from **27 to 37 per 10,000 active developers (+31%)** after a Console release.

High AI resolution combined with a rising contact rate can mean the support operation is succeeding while the product is failing. Support automation reduces the cost of demand. Only product improvement can eliminate avoidable demand.

## What you can do in the app

| Workspace | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **1. Overview** | Headline KPIs, top support drivers, demand handled by AI, humans, self-service and product changes, and the ladder from deflection to resolution to verified resolution to demand elimination |
| **2. Support Intelligence** | A driver explorer with 15 filters and search, normalized contact rates, emerging-driver alerts, and a full **API Key Management investigation**: 12-week trend with release and signal markers, segments, telemetry, Dynatrace and SolarWinds signals, representative cases, and an AI summary that separates observation, correlation and inference. Ends with a **product-opportunity drawer** that requires human approval |
| **3. Agent Trust Lab** | Eight scenarios covering ANSWER, CLARIFY, RETRIEVE, USE TOOL, ESCALATE and REFUSE. Each shows simulated tool calls and results (secret key material is never returned), a structured escalation package, and an evaluation panel. Includes a what-if where escalation is the correct outcome |
| **4. Product Outcomes** | A lifecycle board (Proposed, In Development, Production & Measuring), roadmap traceability (objective → Jira Align epic → Azure DevOps feature → stories → release → measurement), dependency risk, and a validated **Usage Billing Transparency** outcome analysis |
| **Ask the Evidence** | Ten evidence queries. Each answer gives a direct response, cited evidence, inference, uncertainty and a next action |

Use **Guided demo** in the header for a 12-step walkthrough. **Reset** clears all decisions for the session.

## Design decisions

- **Normalized contact rates.** Contact rate = contacts for a driver ÷ relevant active population × 10,000. Active developers grow 29% across the 12 weeks, and raw volume alone would mislead.
- **Deflection is not success.** Verified resolution, recontact, customer effort and demand elimination are measured separately. Lower AI case volume after a product fix is treated as a positive outcome.
- **Correlation is not causation.** Every AI statement is labelled as observation, evidence, correlation, inference, uncertainty or recommendation. Contradictory and missing evidence are shown next to the supporting evidence.
- **Human oversight.** Assigning owners, creating roadmap items, editing hypotheses, dismissing material trends and declaring outcomes all require explicit human action, and each is written to a decision log. A single case cannot create an epic. Alerts come from an aggregation rule.
- **Escalation is not failure.** The Trust Lab grades a correct escalation as a pass.
- **Deterministic AI.** Outputs are pre-authored so every visitor sees the intended behavior, and no API keys live in a public static site.

## Architecture

- React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Recharts + Lucide icons, built with Vite. No backend.
- `src/data/`: the normalized model (23 entity types), seeded synthetic generators and mock source adapters (ServiceNow, Dynatrace, SolarWinds, Azure DevOps, Jira Align, agent logs). Swapping a mock for a real client changes only the adapter.
- `src/store.ts`: session state (Zustand, persisted to `sessionStorage`).
- `scripts/check-data.ts`: verifies that the dataset reproduces every headline number (127,842 cases, 46 per 10k, 61% / 27% / 8%, and the API-key story). It runs in CI before every deploy.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # local dev server
npm run check-data   # dataset consistency checks
npm run build        # production build in dist/
```

Pushes to `main` deploy to GitHub Pages through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
